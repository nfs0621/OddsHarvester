### **🐳 Running Inside a Docker Container**

OddsHarvester is compatible with Docker, allowing you to run the application seamlessly in a containerized environment.

**Steps to Run with Docker:**

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**  
   Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system. Visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/) for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. **Build the Docker Image**  
   Navigate to the project's root directory, where the `Dockerfile` is located. Build the Docker image using the appropriate Docker build command.  
   Assign a name to the image, such as `odds-harvester`: `docker build -t odds-harvester:local --target local-dev .`

3. **Run the Container**  
   Start a Docker container based on the built image. Map the necessary ports if required and specify any volumes to persist data. Pass any CLI arguments (e.g., `scrape_upcoming`) as part of the Docker run command: 
   `docker run --rm odds-harvester:latest python3 -m main scrape_upcoming --sport football --date 20250125 --markets 1x2 --storage local --file_path output.json --headless`

4.	**Interactive Mode for Debugging**
   If you need to debug or run commands interactively: `docker run --rm -it odds-harvester:latest /bin/bash`

**Tips**:
- **Volume Mapping**: Use volume mapping to store logs or output data on the host machine.  
- **Container Reusability**: Assign a unique container name to avoid conflicts when running multiple instances.


### **☁️ Cloud Deployment**

OddsHarvester can also be deployed on a cloud provider using the **Serverless Framework**, with a Docker image to ensure compatibility with AWS Lambda (Dockerfile will need to be tweaked if you want to deploy on a different cloud provider).

**Why Use a Docker Image?**

1.	AWS Lambda's Deployment Size Limit:
   AWS Lambda has a hard limit of 50MB for direct deployment packages, which includes code, dependencies, and assets. Playwright and its browser dependencies far exceed this limit.

2.	Playwright's Incompatibility with Lambda Layers:
   Playwright cannot be installed as an AWS Lambda layer because:
      •	Its browser dependencies require system libraries that are unavailable in Lambda's standard runtime environment.
      •	Packaging these libraries within Lambda layers would exceed the layer size limit.

3.	Solution:
   Using a Docker image solves these limitations by bundling the entire runtime environment, including Playwright, its browsers, and all required libraries, into a single package. This ensures a consistent and compatible execution environment.


**Serverless Framework Setup:**

1. **Serverless Configuration**:  
   The application includes a `serverless.yaml` file located at the root of the project. This file defines the deployment configuration for a serverless environment. Users can customize the configuration as needed, including:
   - **Provider**: Specify the cloud provider (e.g., AWS).
   - **Region**: Set the desired deployment region (e.g., `eu-west-3`).
   - **Resources**: Update the S3 bucket details or permissions as required.

2. **Docker Integration**:  
   The app uses a Docker image (`playwright_python_arm64`) to ensure compatibility with the serverless architecture. The Dockerfile is already included in the project and configured in `serverless.yaml`. 
   You'll need to build the image locally (see section above) and push the Docker image to ECR.

3. **Permissions**:  
   By default, the app is configured with IAM roles to:
   - Upload (`PutObject`), retrieve (`GetObject`), and delete (`DeleteObject`) files from an S3 bucket.  
     Update the `Resource` field in `serverless.yaml` with the ARN of your S3 bucket.

4. **Function Details**:
   - **Function Name**: `scanAndStoreOddsPortalDataV2`
   - **Memory Size**: 2048 MB
   - **Timeout**: 360 seconds
   - **Event Trigger**: Runs automatically every 2 hours (`rate(2 hours)`) via EventBridge.


**Customizing Your Configuration:**
To tailor the serverless deployment for your needs:
- Open the `serverless.yaml` file in the root directory.
- Update the relevant fields:
  - S3 bucket ARN in the IAM policy.
  - Scheduling rate for the EventBridge trigger.
  - Resource limits (e.g., memory size or timeout).


**Deploying to your prefered Cloud provider:**
1. Install the Serverless Framework:
   - Follow the installation guide at [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/).
2. Deploy the application:
   - Use the `sls deploy` command to deploy the app to your cloud provider.
3. Verify the deployment:
   - Confirm that the function is scheduled correctly and check logs or S3 outputs.


## **⚙️ Configuration**

### Constants

OddsHarvester uses a [`constants.py`](src/utils/constants.py) file to define important parameters for browser configuration and scraping behavior. Users can customize these parameters directly in the file to suit their needs. Key configurable constants include:

- **`ODDS_FORMAT`**: Configure the desired odds format (e.g., `Decimal Odds`, `Fractional Odds`).
- **`SCRAPE_CONCURRENCY_TASKS`**: Adjust the number of concurrent tasks the scraper can handle. Controls how many pages or tasks are processed simultaneously. Increasing this value can speed up scraping but may increase the risk of being blocked by the target website. Use cautiously based on your network and system capabilities.
